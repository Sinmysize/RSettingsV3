# RSettingsV3

This C# program automatically changes the grapics settings for Roblox

(This Is Also My First Offical C# Project)

To My Knowledge This Works With Windows Only (I Could Be Wrong)

# How To Use It:

1. Download The Zip And Extract It.
2. Run The Executable
3. Now You Can Use Alt + Enter For True Full Screen.
4. If A Roblox Update Occurs Just Run The Program Again.

# What Does The Program Do?

This program puts a file in your current roblox directory which allows the user to have true fullscreen (Alt + Enter) and the full 21 graphics bars.

# Is This Harmful In Anyway?

No. The program only changes your roblox graphics settings. This will not be detected by Byfron.
